# track-achievements
Track your daily achievements to know your real productivity and progress. Here you will see the actual value of your habits.

## Project description

### App features:
The application can help you to track your daily achievement, and many analysis services to show your progress, This is the big picture of the app services:
-  Adding measuring achievement standard: With this service, you can choose a measuring standard for your achievement. such as: you want to track your reading books for one hour by adding the number of pages that you read in the day, and track your hour achievements across days.
- Tracking daily achievement: This service uses the previous one and asks you what you achieved today for each measuring achievement standard you recorded before.
- Analyses service: Here you will have 7 services until now, help you to make several analytics for your achievements.

### App technologies:
For this app, I used these technologies:
- Java programming language: for training reasons.
- SQLite DB: The app is simple and I find that it will be enough.
- Class diagrams with UML: This is one of the main reasons for building the app. I learned about this diagram and its principles and I built this project to test my knowledge.
- JDBC driver: I used this driver to reference my app to help my Java code communicate with SQLite.

### Main challenges I face in this project:
There are main challenges that I faced from the beginning of the planning for the application to the end of this process, and these are the main challenges:
- In the beginning of the planning I find it's a challenge problem to determine the relations between my classes.
- In the middle of the project I found a specific problem with the MeasuringAchievemntStandard class, And I solved it by changing my class diagrams by adding a new class called MesuringAchievementStandardServices.
- At the end of the project I found a problem with the DB with a complex conditional command, that gave me strange results, and I solved it by making my conditions more specific and logical by just adding parentheses "()".

## Installing and Running
### Install the project:
To install the project you can open your terminal and enter this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed101Mohammed/track-achievements.git
```
### Run the project:
If you expert than me I expect that you can run this project in way easy than I am. What I will explain is takes some time because I can use the project only in the VS code terminal.
follow these steps:
#### First Step:
If you don't have extensions to run Java code install these extensions from vs code extensions:
- Extension Pack for Java (This extension contains all the extensions you need).
#### Second Step:
Install the jar file of [this website](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.42.0.1)
#### Third Step:
Open the project folder with vs code by typing:
```
code .
```
In the terminal when being in the directory of the project "track-achievements".
#### Fourth Step:
- In the VS code environment in the EXPLORER tap, you will find at the bottom this tap: "> JAVA PROJECTS".
- Click on the tap and you will see a new tap called: "> [] track-achievements".
- Click on it and many taps will appear, Make the mouse over on this tap: "> [] Referenced Libraries"
- Then the plus + sign will appear. Press it and find the file that you installed in the ***Therd Step***.

#### Fifth Step (finally):
In the VS Code environment go to the **App** folder and open the **Main.java** file.
Above the **main** method, you will find ***Run*** word, Press it.
The project will run in a terminal and you can use it.

## How you can Contribute
I expect that you know how to fork and pull in GitHub.
All you can do is: pull your contribution with none strange files. And a deep explanation about the bug that you solved or the feature that you added.
I hope you find a better way to run the app and upgrade the ReadMe file with it. But this way should work with me to accept it.
Thanks.
